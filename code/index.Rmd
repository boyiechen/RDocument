### How to add/edit the documentation
To Be Added

```{r, eval=FALSE}

                      output_dir = "./../docs/")
```

### Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

### Editing Reference
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

### Privacy and Sharing

The docs will **not** publish any code detail to the public since it is made for the people who work under the project.
Some function names, code snippets, and relations between scripts may be shown in the docs, while **all full scripts should be displayed with links to the repository of the project** to keep the docs up to date and prevent from data leaking.

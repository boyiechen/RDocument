This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() Editing Reference Privacy and Sharing The docs will not publish any code detail to the public since it is made for the people who work under the project. Some function names, code snippets, and relations between scripts may be shown in the docs, while all full scripts should be displayed with links to the repository of the project to keep the docs up to date and prevent from data leaking. "],["structure.html", "Chapter 1 The structure of the codes Data Creation Analysis Knitting", " Chapter 1 The structure of the codes In this chapter, we list the structure of the code for the project. Codes are categorized in the following categories by their usage: 1. data creation 2. analysis 1. data cleaning/manipulation 2. data merge 3. estimations 4. counterfactual analysis 3. table and figure knitting 1. summary statistics 2. regressions 3. histograms and other figures The following sections display the tree diagrams of the scripts, and show the dependencies of each script. Note that a .R file indicates a single script, and some features may require more than one script to realize.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["blocks.html", "Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations 5.2 Theorems and proofs 5.3 Callout blocks", " Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (5.1). 5.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 5.1.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.

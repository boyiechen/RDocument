This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() Editing Reference Privacy and Sharing The docs will not publish any code detail to the public since it is made for the people who work under the project. Some function names, code snippets, and relations between scripts may be shown in the docs, while all full scripts should be displayed with links to the repository of the project to keep the docs up to date and prevent from data leaking. "],["structure.html", "Chapter 1 The structure of the codes Data Creation Analysis Knitting", " Chapter 1 The structure of the codes In this chapter, we list the structure of the code for the project. Codes are categorized in the following categories by their usage: 1. data creation 2. analysis 1. data cleaning/manipulation 2. data merge 3. estimations 4. counterfactual analysis 3. table and figure knitting 1. summary statistics 2. regressions 3. histograms and other figures The following sections display the tree diagrams of the scripts, and show the dependencies of each script.
